/// The contributions are not enforced, rather this is a voluntary society.
/// It is ones civic duty as a socialist to contribute ALL resources.
///
/// Every so often the pooled resources are split among the members.
/// Every member is allowed to make a claim stating how much they need, and is expected to claim ONLY what they need.
/// Again, it is one's civic duty as a socialist to claim only what they need, and no more.
/// The payout period (the time between consecutive payouts) is at least 100 blocks.
/// Said another way, the payout frequency is at most one payout per hundred blocks.
/// The period is not fixed because they have to be manually triggered.

/// The goal of socialism is that all members' needs are met when possible, and the distribution is still fair when not all needs can be met.
/// As long as everyone follows their civic duty, all needs can be met when there are enough resources.
/// In times of plenty, all needs may be met, and a surplus may even begin to form.
/// Unfortunately, in times of scarcity, not all members will have their needs met.

// Enhancement: make it work with an userspace asset instead of just the native token.

// Enhancement: When performing payouts, you are probably doing some sorting on-chain.
// Sorting on-chain is inefficient, and a good optimisation is to sort off-chain and
// only check the sorting on-chain. Try that advice.
// Your trigger_payouts function should have a new parameter: the pre-sorted list.

// Enhancement: When the dao does not have enough resources to meet everyones needs,
// it still must decide which members get how much. The algorithm you coded above is one
// reasonable approach, but there are others. Maybe if the dao has enough to meet
// 80% of the total need, then every member gets 80% of the total need.
//
// Abstract the payout algorithm into a Solidity `Interface`, and move the existing algo
// to a contract that implements the interface. Then implement the new payout algo as
// a second contract. Try to think of a third way the socialists could divide their
// resources during times of want and implement it.

// Enhancement: Make the minimum payout period configurable in the constructor.
