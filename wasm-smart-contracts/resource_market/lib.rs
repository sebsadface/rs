    // by simplying calling a function with an integer parameter. Presumably there is

    // are actually made. But there are no on-chain assets underlying the resource market.
    // Modify the code to interface with three real ERC20 tokens called: Water, Wood, and Food.

    // Enhancement: The resource trading logic in this contract is useful for way more
    // scenarios than our simple wood, food, water trade. Generalize the contract to
    // work with up to 5 arbitrary ERC20 tokens.

    // Enhancement: If we are trading real food, wood, and water, we have real-world incentives
    // to deposit ou excess resources. Storage is hard IRL. Water evaporates, food spoils, and wood rots.
    // And all the resources are subject to robbery. But if we are talking about virtual assets,
    // there are no such risks. And depositing funds into the market comes with an opportunity cost.
    // Design a reward system where there is a small fee on every withdrawal, and that fee is paid to
    // liquidity providers.
